  ANT.      With pleasure, nobody contradicente!

                      SONG—ANTONIO and CHORUS.

                 For the merriest fellows are we, tra la,
                 That ply on the emerald sea, tra la;
                      With loving and laughing,
                      And quipping and quaffing,
                 We're happy as happy can be, tra la—
                      With loving and laughing, etc.

                 With sorrow we've nothing to do, tra la,
                 And care is a thing to pooh-pooh, tra la;
                      And Jealousy yellow,
                      Unfortunate fellow,
                 We drown in the shimmering blue, tra la—
                      And Jealousy yellow, etc.

  FIA. (looking off). See, see, at last they come to make their
  choice—
                 Let us acclaim them with united voice.
  (Marco and Giuseppe appear in gondola at back.)

  CHORUS (Girls).     Hail, hail! gallant gondolieri, ben venuti!
       Accept our love, our homage, and our duty.
                      Ben' venuti! ben' venuti!

  (Marco and Giuseppe jump ashore—the Girls salute them.)

           DUET—MARCO and GIUSEPPE, with CHORUS OF GIRLS.

  MAR. and GIU.  Buon' giorno, signorine!

  GIRLS.              Gondolieri carissimi!
                 Siamo contadine!

  MAR. and GIU. (bowing).  Servitori umilissimi!
                      Per chi questi fiori—
                           Questi fiori bellissimi?

  GIRLS.              Per voi, bei signori
                           O eccellentissimi!

  (The Girls present their bouquets to Marco and Giuseppe, who are
  overwhelmed with them, and carry them with difficulty.)

  MAR. and GIU. (their arms full of flowers). O ciel'! O ciel'!
